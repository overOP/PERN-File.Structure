1. node_modules/
What it is: The toy box where all your dependencies (other people's code) live.

Don't touch it! It's managed by npm/yarn. If you delete it, just run npm install to refill it.

2. public/
What it is: Like your "photo album" folder.

What goes here: Images, fonts, and static files (like favicon.ico).

3. src/ (The Magic Kitchen 🧙‍♂️)
This is where your app's code lives.

🍰 app/ (Next.js App Router)
layout.tsx → The "frame" of your app (like the walls of a house).

page.tsx → Your homepage (the living room).

(public)/ → Pages anyone can see (like a storefront).

(protected)/ → Pages only logged-in users see (like a VIP lounge).

(admin)/ → Pages only admins see (like the owner's office).

api/ → Your app's "waiters" that handle requests (like taking orders).

🎨 components/ (UI Lego Blocks)
Reusable pieces like buttons, headers, and forms.

Example: Button.tsx = A clickable candy button.

🚀 features/ (App Superpowers)
Each folder is a feature (like auth, user, admin).

Contains everything needed for that feature (components, hooks, services).

🎣 hooks/ (Custom React Hooks)
Tiny reusable functions (like useDebounce for search bars).

🌍 context/ (Global State)
Like a "shared notebook" all components can read from (e.g., AuthContext for user data).

🔧 lib/ (Tools & Utilities)
Helper functions (like prisma.ts for database connections).

🗄️ prisma/ (Database Manager)
schema.prisma = Your database blueprint (like LEGO instructions).

seed.ts = Fake data for testing (like toy food in a play kitchen).

🖥️ server/ (Backend Brain)
Express.js server (handles heavy lifting like auth and databases).

routes/ = URL paths (like /login).

controllers/ = Logic for routes (like "how to log in").

4. Config Files (App Settings ⚙️)
next.config.ts → Next.js settings (like turning on features).

tsconfig.json → TypeScript rules (like grammar rules for code).

.env → Secrets (API keys, passwords – never share this!).

5. package.json (App Recipe Book)
Lists all ingredients (dependencies) and scripts (commands like npm run dev).
